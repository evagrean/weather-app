# Bring your Umbrella

This is a weather app project from [The Net Ninja's Modern JavaScript Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-javascript-from-novice-to-ninja/) on Udemy. I wrote it to practise working with an external API, asynchronous techniques and DOM manipulation.

I used the free [AccuWeather API](https://developer.accuweather.com/) to get weather information.
